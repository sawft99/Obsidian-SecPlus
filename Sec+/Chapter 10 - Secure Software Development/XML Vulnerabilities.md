- Extensible Markup Language (XML)
	- Used for authentication, authorization, and other types of data exchange or uploads
- May be referred to as an "XML Injection" but this is not technically correct as the vulnerabilities lie in parsing
- XML data is submitted from you to the server or from server to server
- So make sure there is encryption and [[SDLC Principles#Never Trust User Input|Input Validation]] otherwise it can be vulnerable to #spoofing, [[XSS and XSRF#Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)|Request Forgery]] and [[SQL Injection#Injection Attack|Injection]] of arbitrary code
