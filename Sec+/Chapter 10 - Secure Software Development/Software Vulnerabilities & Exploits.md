# Directory Traversal
---
- A method of accessing unauthorized parent (or worse, root) directories ^82f4b4
- It is often used on web servers that have PHP files and are Linux or UNIX-based, but it can also be perpetrated on #Microsoft  operating systems (in which case it would be ..\ or the “dot-dot-backslash” attack) ^1d64fb
- It is designed to get access to files such as ones that contain passwords
- Usually done on pages that have dynamic elements and that take input
	- Example
		- https://example.com/?file=../../../../etc/passwd
		- "?file" represents a variable that takes input
		- "../../../../etc/passwd" attempts to move up to the root directory and then read the "passwd" file in the "etc" folder
		- If successful the result would be the password file displaying passwords in the browser
- Can also be used to perform [[#Arbitrary Code Execution]]
- Aka "Path Traversal"

# Arbitrary Code Execution
---
- Occurs when an attacker is able to execute or run communards on a <u>victim computer</u> ^5eb74f
- [[#Remote Code Execution (RCE)]] is a form of [[#Arbitrary Code Execution]]

# Remote Code Execution (RCE)
---
- Occurs when an attacker is able to execute or run commands on a <u>remote computer</u> ^861a4f
- Can be run remotely such as an interactive shell
- Considered one of the worst types of vulnerabilities
- Classified under the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE)

# Zero Day
---
- Attack against a vulnerability that is unknown to the original developer or manufacturer ^cce8ca
- Currently companies will pay larger amounts of money to have pen testers discover vulnerabilities in their software
	- Sometimes via bug bounty programs
