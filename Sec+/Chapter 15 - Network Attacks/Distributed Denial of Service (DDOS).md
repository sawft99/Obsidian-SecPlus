# About
---
- A group of compromised systems attack a single target simultaneously to create a [[Denial of Service (DoS)]] ^319c1b
- Often hundreds or thousands
- Most machines don't realize they are contributing to a DDOS attack since they are often [[Botnets & Zombies#^3c2842|Zombies]] within a [[Botnets & Zombies|Botnet]]
- Most modern systems are not vulnerable to a simple [[Denial of Service (DoS)]] from one machine

# DNS Amplification
---
- A type of DDOS which relies on the large amount of DNS information that is sent in response to a [[Spoofing|spoofed]] query on behalf of the victimized server ^42747f
- DNS requests are small to send but the responses are several time larger resulting in the 'amplification' of the attack
