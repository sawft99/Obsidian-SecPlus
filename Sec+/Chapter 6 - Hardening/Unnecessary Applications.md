# About
---
- Every app introduces additional code and therefore <u>additional vulnerabilities</u>
	- Leaves opportunities for more [[Software Vulnerabilities & Exploits#Zero Day|Zero Days]] and other vulnerabilities
- Administrators practice [[#Least Functionality]]
- Personal computers are more likely to have unnecessary programs

# Least Functionality
---
- Process of configuring a workstation or server to <u>only provide essential applications and services</u> required by the user ^9df915
	- Don't confuse with [[SDLC Principles#Least Privilege|Least Privilege]]
- <u>Restrict unneeded applications, service, ports, and protocols</u>
- Uninstall any unneeded apps
	- Every app needs to be managed and updated

# Baseline Image

	- Configuration policies

# System Center Configuration Management (SCCM)
---
- Used in larger work environments
- Allows admins to <u>manage large amounts of software</u> ^0c7124
- Push out new configurations and policies to PCs
