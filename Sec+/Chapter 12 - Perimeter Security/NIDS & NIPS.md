- Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
	- Attempts to detect, log, and alert of malicious network activities
	- Such as port scans or #DDoS 
		- Behind [[Firewalls]] gives it less incoming traffic to analyze
	- Runs in promiscuous mode
		- Sees all traffic crossing the network versus only the traffic meant for the device MAC address
	- Can only detect, monitor, or alert with heuristics or [[IDS#^646241|Signatures]]
- See also [[IDS]]
