# IP Proxy
---
- Used to secure a network by keeping its machines anonymous during web browsing
- Computer that is receiving a request from a proxy will see the web request come from the proxy and not the device that originally made the request
- Proxy is using [[Network Address Translation]] to accomplish this

# Caching Proxy
---
- Attempts to serve client requests by delivering the content to the client from itself without contacting the remote server each time
- Once you visit a website the proxy will temporarily hold a copy of that website for a set amount of time depending on the configuration
- The next time someone makes a request for the website the proxy itself will instead deliver the content if it is still cached
