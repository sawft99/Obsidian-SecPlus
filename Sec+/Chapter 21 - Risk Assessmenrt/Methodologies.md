- You use Security Assessments to determine [[Risk Assessments#Risk|Risk]]
	- Verifies the org sec posture is design end conf properly to help thwart different types of attacks and [[Risk Assessments#Threats|Threats]]
- Can include
	- Vulnerability assessment
		- Scans across network to find [[Switches#Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]] using a fully credentialed and authorized account
	- Pen testing
		- Can be conducted from outside network without credentials
	- Internal/external audit
	- Self assessment
	- Password analysis
	- More
- May need to perform due to organizations risk policy, contract, legal. or regulatory requirements
	- Federal Information Systems Management Act (FISMA) - Legal/Regulation
	- Payment Card Industry Digital Security Standard (PCIDSS) - Contractual
- Methods
	- [[#Active Scanning]]
	- [[#Passive Scanning]]

# Active Scanning
---
- Utilizes more intrusive scanning, hands on testing, and probing of the network to determine what [[Switches#Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]] might exist ^7ea3f5
- Could cause equipment to go down or offline if scans are too aggressive
- Collects a larger amount of data

# Passive Scanning
---
- Utilizes #OSINT, passive collection and analysis of network data and other unobtrusive methods without making direct contact with the targeted systems ^530445
- Find open ports and software being run without ever making direct contact with a system
- More limited in scope
