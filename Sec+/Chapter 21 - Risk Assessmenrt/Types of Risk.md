# External Risk
---
- Risks that are produced by a <u>non human source</u> and are beyond human control ^e9c60e
- You can [[Risk Assessments#Mitigate|Mitigate]] the risk with things like battery backups or stronger buildings
- Example
	- Natural disasters such as wildfires or hurricanes
	- Blackouts
		- Not something you or the organization controls
	- [[SecBasics#Hackers|Hackers]]
		- Human source but beyond your control

# Internal Risk
---
- Risks that are <u>formed within the organization</u>, arise during normal operations, and are often forecastable ^0a3baf
- Example
	- Server crash
		- Knowing that certain conditions can or are met that will cause this

# Legacy Systems
---
- An <u>old method, technology, computer system, or application</u> which includes an outdated computer system still in use ^0175b6
- [[HVAC#ICS & SCADA Systems|ICS & SCADA Systems]] and other [[Embedded System Vulnerabilities|Embedded Systems]] are common sources
- Employ [[Risk Assessments#Mitigate|Mitigation]] strategies
	- Don't connect them to the internet
	- [[Firewalls]]
	- [[VLAN]]

# Multiparty
---
- A risk that refers to the <u>connections of multiple systems or organizations</u> with each bringing their own inherit risks ^1e1402

# Intellectual Property (IP) Theft
---

# Software Compliance & Licensing
---
- Adherence to policies and standards with regard to the entitlement and legal use of software ^837caf
- Risk associated with a company not being aware of what software or components are installed within the network
- You want a program to meet the organizations policies and standards that could dictate what programs are secure and which aren't  
- Example
	- Whether an individual does this or it is a new policy, introducing a new program could bring on additional risk if it is not audited or approved
	- Downloading #Windows and installing it without licensing it properly
		- The OS may become crippled in some way or #Microsoft could sue for damages since you used their product without permission or proper licensing
