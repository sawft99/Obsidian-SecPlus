# About
---
- Security Information and Event Management Systems
	- "Seems"
- A solution that provides real-time or near real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications  ^b02c55
- Logs are gathered form a number of systems
- Shouldn't only look at logs as part of Incident Response
- Use proactively such as in [[SecBasics#Threat Hunting|Threat Hunting]]
- Helps corollate events
	- Example
		- A user on vacation in another country logs in and it is recorded
		- Moments later an event is recorded showing them logging into your home country locally
		- These events by themselves may not raise flags, but together they can since it would not be possible to be in two places at once or cover that much distance quickly
- Can be hardware, software, or outsourced to someone else
- Commercial or open source
