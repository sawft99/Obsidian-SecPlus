# About
---
- Security Information and Event Management Systems
	- "Seems"
- A solution that provides real-time or near real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications  ^b02c55
- Logs are gathered form a number of systems
- Shouldn't only look at logs as part of Incident Response
	- Use proactively such as in [[SecBasics#Threat Hunting|Threat Hunting]]
- Helps corollate events
	- Example
		- A user on vacation in another country logs in and it is recorded
		- Moments later an event is recorded showing them logging into your home country locally
		- These events by themselves may not raise flags, but together they can since it would not be possible to be in two places at once or cover that much distance quickly
- Can be hardware, software, or outsourced to someone else
- Commercial or open source

# Setup
---
1. Log relevant data only
2. Establish and document scope of events
	1. What do you want to log
3. Develop use case to define a [[Risk Assessments#Threats|Threat]]
	1. What you do or don't consider a [[Risk Assessments#Threats|Threat]]
4. Plan incident response for a given event
	1. Preplanned responses based on the event
5. Establish a ticketing process to track events
	1. Make sure it is not forgotten about
6. Schedule regular [[SecBasics#Threat Hunting|Threat Hunting]]
7. Provide auditors and analysists an evidence trails

# Types

## Splunk
---
- A market-leading big data information gathering and analysis tool that can import machine generated data via a connector or visibility add-on
- Connects many different types of systems
	- Premade connectors and support already exist for most major hardware and applications
- Indexed and then written to a central database
- Proprietary "Search Processing Language"
- Visualizes data
- Local or cloud based installs

## ELK/Elastic Stack

### About
---
- Collection of free and open source SIEM tools that provide storage, search, and analysis functions

### Components
----
1. Elasticsearch - Query/Analytics
2. Logstash - Log Collection/Normalization
3. Kibana - Visualization
4. Beats - Endpoint Collection [[SNMP#Agents|Agents]]

### Flow
---
1. Beats are similar to [[SNMP#Agents|Agents]]  and reside on servers or hosts
2. Send to [[#ELK/Elastic Stack]] or Logstash
	1. When in Logstash it does the parsing for you and then goes to [[#ELK/Elastic Stack]]
	2. If sending to [[#ELK/Elastic Stack]] directly it needs to already be in a format it understands
3. Look at Kobana to see elastic data in a way for you to understand
