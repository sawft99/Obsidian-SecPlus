# About
---
- The practice and study of writing and solving codes in order to hide the true meaning of information ^f77f15
- Most commonly used as a form of encryption
	- The process of converting ordinary information (plaintext) into an unintelligible form (ciphertext) ^e590e3
	- Protects [[#Data at Rest]], [[#Data in Transit]], and [[#Data in Use]]
- See also
	- [[Disk Encryption]]
# Data types

## Data at Rest
---
- Inactive data that is archived, such as data on a hard drive ^44fd90

## Data in Transit
---
- Data crossing the network or data in a computers memory ^61a9df

## Data in Use
---
- Data that is undergoing change ^2df323

# Algorithm 
---
- A mathematical output that tells you how you will encrypt or decrypt something ^0d1470

# Cipher
---
- An [[#Algorithm]] which performs the encryption or decryption ^fc99f4
- See also
	- [[Symmetric vs Asymmetric#Cipher Types]]

# Key
---
- Essential piece of information that determines the output of a [[#Cipher]] ^7a4dc0
- <u>The strength of encryption comes from the key</u> not the [[#Algorithm]]
