- Encrypted
	- Viruses try to <u>hide</u> themselves
	- Uses cipher to avoid #AntiVirus
- Polymorphic
	- <u>Advanced encrypted</u> virus
	- Changes code each time it is executed by changing encrypted module each time
	- Avoids signature based #AntiVirus
- Metamorphic
	- <u>Rewrites itself</u> entirely before infecting
	- A more <u>advanced</u> version of polymorphic
- Stealth
	- More of a broad <u>category</u>

	- A form of #SocialEngineering
		- Popup on website
		- Fake tech support call
