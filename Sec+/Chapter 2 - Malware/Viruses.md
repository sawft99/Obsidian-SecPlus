# About
---
   - <u>Malicious code</u> that runs on a machine <u>without the users knowledge</u> infects the computer <u>once executed</u> ^c54698
   - Downloading a file from the internet which ay contain the viral code
   - Virus reproduces and runs due to #UserAction

# Types
---
- <u>Boot sector</u>
	- Stored in <u>first sector</u> of a hard drive
	- Loaded into memory on bootup
	- [[Endpoint Analysis#AntiVirus (AV)|AntiVirus (AV)]] will not easily find unless it specifically looks for this
- <u>Macro</u>
	- Virus <u>embedded inside another document</u>
	- Opening document executes because of #UserAction
	- Powerpoint, Excel, Word docs
- <u>Program</u>
	- Infect an <u>app or executable</u>
	- Every time you open a program it loads
- <u>Multipartite</u>
	- <u>Combines</u> boot and program types
	- Places self in boot sector so it is loaded every boot and installs itself into a program
- <u>Encrypted</u>
	- Viruses try to <u>hide</u> themselves with [[Disk Encryption#^501400|Encryption]]
	- Uses cipher to avoid [[Endpoint Analysis#AntiVirus (AV)|AntiVirus (AV)]]
- <u>Polymorphic</u>
	- <u>More advanced version of encrypted</u> virus
	- Changes code <u>each time it is executed</u> by changing [[Disk Encryption#^501400|Encryption]] module
	- Avoids signature based [[Endpoint Analysis#AntiVirus (AV)|AntiVirus (AV)]]
- <u>Metamorphic</u>
	- <u>Rewrites itself</u> entirely before infecting
	- A more <u>advanced version of polymorphic</u>
- <u>Stealth</u>
	- More of a <u>broad category</u>
	- Encrypted, metamorphic, polymorphic types
- <u>Armored</u>
	- A layer of protection to <u>confuse</u> a program or person trying to analyze it
- <u>Hoax</u>
	- <u>Trick user</u> into infecting their machine with #UserAction
	- A form of #SocialEngineering
		- Popup on website
		- Fake tech support call
