# About
---
- Software designed to <u>gain admin level control without detection</u>
- #Windows admin access and #Linux root access
- VERY difficult to detect and remove
- Boot to/scan with external system and #AntiVirus

# Kernel
---
- The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. ^81adf2

## Rings
---
- Level of permissions
	- Closer to the kernel the more damage
- Ring 3 is normal user level
- Ring 1 would be an admin/root account
- Ring 0 is kernel
	- Controls access like #Drivers   and hardware
- Rootkits try to install at ring 1 or ring 0 to avoid detection from users, admins, and even the OS

# #DLL Injection
---
- Malicious code is inserted into #Windows #DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file with a running process ^47df2b
	- #DLL files are loaded at #Runtime
- #Windows may not even know it has a rootkit
- #Drivers  manipulation
	- Compromising the [[Rootkits#Kernel|Kernel]] mode #Drivers  that operate with extra privileges or system level
- Rootkits intercepts a call between #Windows and a #DLL with a #Shim
	- Redirect shim contains malicious code
