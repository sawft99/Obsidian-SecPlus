# About
---
- The sequence or system of organizations or operations that work together to design, produce, and deliver a product or service to a market, extending from the extraction of raw materials to the distribution of finished products or services ^69419f
- Part of securing an unsecure environment involves mitigating risks from supply chain
- Create a [[#Trusted Computing Environment]]

# Trusted Computing Environment
---
- Ensuring that the operation of every element of (hardware, [[Securing the BIOS#^9479f4|Firmware]], #Drivers , OS, and applications) is consistent and tamper resistant ^8320bc

# Process
---
1. When working with a new vendor perform <u>Due Diligence</u>
	1. A legal Principle identifying a subject has used <u>best practice or reasonable care</u> when setting up, configuring, and maintaining a system ^cae203
		1. <u>Apply to suppliers and contractors as well</u>
	2. Both vendor and you need to perform this
2. Ensure
	1. Properly resourced cybersecurity team
	2. Security assurance and risk management processes in place
		1. <u>Allows them to perform due diligence</u>
	3. Product support life cycles in place
		1. Need to make sure a product can be supported for a long term
		2. Support and updates with an <u>End of Life (EOL)</u> definition
			1. The final day when a product will stop being supported and will no longer receive updates ^01cc85
	4. Proper security controls for [[SecBasics#^9c173d|confidential]] data
	5. Proper Incident response and forensic assistance
	6. General and historical company information
		1. Strong financials

# Trusted Foundry
---
- A microprocessor manufacturing utility that is part of a validated supply chain (one where hardware and software does not deviate from its documented function) ^3779ea
- <u>Created and run by Department of Defense (DOD)</u> to ensures a microprocessor is secure

# Hardware Source Authenticity
---
- The process of ensuring that hardware is procured tamper free from untrustworthy suppliers ^c74a15
	- Buying from authorized reseller vs from secondhand
	- Greater risk of counterfeit or compromised devices otherwise
		- [[Malware]] embedded in the [[Securing the BIOS#^9479f4|Firmware]] or extra chips on the device
	- When possible go straight to source

# Vocab
---
- Risk of appetite
	- The amount, rate or percentage of risk an individual, or organization is willing to accept in return for its plan, objectives and innovation. ^251acb
	- Organization defines how much time, effort, and resources it dedicates
