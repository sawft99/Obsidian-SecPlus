# Mantrap
---
- An [[Access Control]]area in a small space that can usually fit only one person and has two sets of interlocking doors; the first set must be closed before the other will open, creating a sort of waiting room where people are identified and can't escape ^d06063
- Can be automated such as the Electronic Locks or a guard needing to buzz you through a door manually
- Common at the entrance of a [[Physical Security#Building|Building]]
	- There may be immediate access to the [[Physical Security#Building|Building]] and more secure areas have a mantrap
	- Or there can be a mantrap at the entrance to the [[Physical Security#Building|Building]] and for secure areas as well
- Prevents "Piggybacking/Piggyback"
	- When an unauthorized person tags along with an authorized person to gain entry to a restricted area ^3161e9
