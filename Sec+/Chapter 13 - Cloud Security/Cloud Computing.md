# About
---
- A way of offering on demand services that extend traditional capabilities of a computer or network
- Increases
	- [[SecBasics#^3803a7|Availability]]
	- [[Virtualization#^a6ee8d|Elasticity]]
	- Resiliency
- Can bring additional security challenges

# Functioning
---
- Many cloud providers and services rely on [[Virtualization]] to gain efficiency and increase cost savings
- Reduce power, space, and cooling
- Achieves higher availability by firing up [[Virtualization#Virtual Machine Types|Virtual Machines]] when needed
	- Allows more dynamic use of server resources like CPU and RAM

# Hyperconvergence
---
- Fully integrate storage, network, and servers
- Don't have to perform hardware changes
- Software and [[Virtualization]] managing integration
- Single interface and device to manage

# Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
---
- A full desktop operating system for an end user to use from a centralized server
- Security benefits example
	- Can create a new [[Virtualization#Virtual Machine Types|Virtual Machine]] every time a user logs in
	- Even if exploited it is non persistent so every time a user logs off the [[Virtualization#Virtual Machine Types|Virtual Machine]] or at midnight, the [[Virtualization#Virtual Machine Types|Virtual Machine]] is destroyed
