# Artificial Intelligence (AI)
---
- The science of creating machines with the ability to <u>develop problem solving and analysis strategies</u> without significant human direction or intervention
- "Original versions" as IF, THEN, ELSE statements with limited data

# Machine Learning (ML)
---
- A component of [[#Artificial Intelligence (AI)]] that enables a machine to develop strategies for solving a task given a labeled dataset where features have been manually identified but <u>without further explicit instructions</u>
- Machine learning is only as good as the dataset used to train it
- ML controls an [[#Artificial Neural Network (ANN)]]

# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
---
- A component of [[#Machine Learning (ML)]] where an architecture input, hidden, and output layers that can perform algorithmic analysis of a dataset to achieve outcome objectives
- The pathways and feedback loop to create IF/THEN style statements
- [[#Machine Learning (ML)]] systems will adjust the ANN to reduce errors and optimizer objectives

# Deep Learning (DL)
---
- A refinement of [[#Machine Learning (ML)]] that enables a machine to develop strategies for solving a task given a labeled dataset and <u>without further explicit instructions</u>
- You only have to give it the data set and the machine does the rest of the "Figuring out"
- Uses complex classes of knowledge defined in relation to simpler classes of knowledge to make more informed determinations about the environment
