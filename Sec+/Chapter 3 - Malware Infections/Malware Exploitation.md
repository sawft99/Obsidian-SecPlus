# About
---
- #Exploit Technique
	- <u>Specific method</u> by which [[Malware]] code infects a target host ^0e3f43

## Methods
---
- "Old days"
	- Rewrite and modify an .exe or Macro so it is loaded when opened
	- [[Worms]] would go through memory and spreading across the network with [[Remote Procedure Calls]]
- Modern
	- Fileless
		-  Makes process <u>in system memory</u> without file system
	- <u>Avoid signature</u> based [[Endpoint Analysis#AntiVirus (AV)|AntiVirus (AV)]]  and host based [[Intrusion Detection Systems]]
	- Directly executed as a #Script or #Shell code
	- Some will be in a temp directory and then run
		- "Relatively" fileless
	- Preferred method by [[SecBasics#^f3f779|Advanced Persistent Threats]]

# [[SecBasics#^f3f779|Advanced Persistent Threats]] steps
---
1. [[#^920747|Dropper]]/Downloader ^c96b2f
	1. Need to get onto pc first
	2. Run light [[#^1bb4ad|Shell Code]] in memory
		1. May use [[#^0c78b2|Code injection]] as one of the methods at this point
		2. May use [[Disk Encryption#^501400|Encryption]], compression, or obfuscation of #Payload  in some way to avoid forensics
		3. May use [[#^2dbb0a|"Living off the land"]] concepts
	3. Trick #UserAction into doing something
	4. Reaches out to #C2 to download more
2. Maintain access
	1. Get something like [[Trojans]]
	2. "On" machine at this point with access
3.  Strengthen access
	1. Infect other systems
	2. Find something of higher value
	3. Infect other machines to have more options
		1. Larger footprint
		2. #LateralMovement
		3. More privileges
4. Action on Objectives
	1. Enough permissions and access to do what they want
		1. Stealing files etc.
5. Concealment
	1. Maintain access
	2. Hide selves and cover tracks
	3. Deleting logs
	4. Stay longer & go back in later on


# Vocab
---
- Dropper
	- [[Malware]] designed to install and/or run other types of [[Malware]] embedded in a #Payload on an infected host ^920747
	- May use [[Disk Encryption#^501400|Encryption]], compression, or obfuscation of #Payload  in some way to avoid forensics
- Shellcode
	- Any lightweight code designed to run an #Exploit on the target which may include any type of code format from #Script  languages to binary code ^1bb4ad
	- Originally referred to a [[Malware]] that gave the attacker a #Shell access
		- <u>Other exams may use this instead</u>
	- Typically part of [[#^c96b2f|Dropper/Downloader]] phase
- Code Injection ^0c78b2
	- #Exploit Technique that runs [[Malware]] code with the identification number ([[Restricting Applications#^206b5d|PID]]?) of a legitimate process ^eab82e
	- Hides [[Malware]] this way
	- Types
		- Masquerading ^b41fd5
			- [[#^920747|Dropper]] replaces legit exe with [[Malware]] ^37eaf8
		- [[Rootkits#DLL Injection|DLL Injection]]
			- Dropper forces DLL to load with [[Malware]]
		- #DLL Sideloading
			- [[#^920747|Dropper]] uses #Exploit vulnerability on a legit program manifest to make it load [[Malware]] ^53d7c6
		- Process Hollowing ^9040b0
			- [[#^920747|Dropper]] starts a process in a suspended state and then rewrites the memory locations containing the process code with the [[Malware]] code
			- Taking over memory and putting [[Malware]] into it
- "Living off the Land" ^2dbb0a
	- [[#Exploit Technique]] using standard system tools and packages to perform intrusions such as PowerShell or Bash
	- Makes it more difficult to find or investigate
