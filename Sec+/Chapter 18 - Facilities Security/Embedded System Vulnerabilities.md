# About
---
- A computer system that is designed to perform a specific and dedicated function
- Part of [[IOT Vulnerabilities|IOT Devices]] and smart devices
- Usually referred to in the manufacturing or automation fields
- Can be very simple or very complex or use a full OS like #Linux  or #Android
- Example
	- Machine measuring amount of liquid going through an IV drip
	- Water treatment plant making sure water is flowing at a certain rate and automatically opening or closing pipes to make sure it does this
	- A power meter on a house that often times connects to the internet

# Static Environments
---
- An environment where changes don't frequently occur or are not allowed at all
- Embedded systems are considered part of a static environment
- The systems being slimmed down to specific functions can make them more secure
- However if the original code has a vulnerability it can be difficult to install [[Updates and Patches]]
