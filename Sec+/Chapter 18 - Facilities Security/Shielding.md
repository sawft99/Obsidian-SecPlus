# About
---
- Prevent [[Securing Network Media#Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)]|Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)]] and [[Securing Network Media#Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)|Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)]] and stealing of information
- Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) cables are good for preventing this
- May also need to shield [[HVAC]] systems since their motors could emit [[Securing Network Media#Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)|Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)]]

# Faraday Cages
---
- Shielding installed around an entire room that prevents [[Securing Network Media#Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)|Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)]] and [[Securing Network Media#Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)|Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)]]
