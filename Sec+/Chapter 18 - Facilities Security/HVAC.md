# About
---
- Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning
- Computers and servers release a lot of heat
- Needs to be dissipated as high temperatures may cause a system to shutdown or overheat
- Computers, servers, and some other equipment have fans built in them to keep the heat out of the system, but the heat will still accumulate overtime in the room

# Hot and Cold Isles
---
- Front of servers face each other in one isle and the backs of servers face each other in the next ^67917f
- Considered the most efficient

# Humidity
---
- HVAC systems can also maintain the proper humidity
- Low  humidity can cause electro static discharge
- High humidity can cause condensation, and thus corrosion, when cold air hits metal
- <u>Best level is at about 40%</u>

# ICS & SCADA Systems
---
- Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA)
- Specialized systems and networks
- Allows a technician to monitor manufacturing and facility systems
- HVAC systems can be integrated into these

# Critical Servers
---
- If your HVAC system were to lose power or go offline for another reason you may be forced to decide what critical servers need to stay up and what other ones can be shut down in order to keep the temperature from rising
