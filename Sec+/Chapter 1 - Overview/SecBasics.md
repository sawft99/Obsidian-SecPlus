---
- Weighing value of #Intelligence
	- Timeliness
		- Is it up to date?
		- #Intelligence Less valuable over time
	- Relevancy
		- Information is relevant to your use case
		- Does it affect your organization?
		- Ex: #OSX hacks in a #Windows environment are likely not relevant
	- Accuracy
		- Produces <u>productive results</u>
		- <u>Valid and true</u> info
		- Checking AI and ML alerts
	- Confidence
		- Producing <u>qualified statements</u>

# Threat Hunting
---
- Cyber security technique designed to <u>detect presence of threats not discovered by normal security monitoring</u> ^2a9491
- Is a <u>proactive method vs reactive</u> such as in Incident Response
- Potentially less disrupting than pen test
	- Analyze data within systems you already have access to
- Process
	- Hypothesis
		- Based from threat model and based on <u>potential events with higher likelihood and impact</u>
		- Who would harm us?
		- How would they harm us?
	- Profiling Threat Actors
		- Create scenarios how intrusion might happen and what motive is TTP
			- Tactics, Techniques, Procedures ^a6b869
		- Who wants to cause harm?
		- What systems?
	- Threat Hunting
		- Using tools for regular security and Incident Response
			- Logs, file, registry changes
			- A #SIEM
		- <u>Assume regular security systems have failed</u>
		- Examine information such as:
			- Network traffic analysis
				- List of suspicious hosts
			- Check executables on hosts
				- Confirm validity of processes
			- Check other hosts

# Attack Frameworks

## Lockheed Martin Kill Chain
---
- About
	- First made under contract
	- Release to public eventually
	- <u>Linear</u> outside from perimeter to inside path
	- Somewhat older
- Steps
	- #Reconnaissance
		- Attacker determines <u>methods to use to attack</u>
			- [[Malware Infections#Attack Vector|Attack Vector]]
		- Attackers try to have a low profile
			- [[Endpoint Analysis#Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)|Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)]]
		- Use #OSINT and passive tools
		- Go from passive to active scanning/actions
		- Identifying where/how to attack target
	- Weaponization
		- Attackers couple #Payload with #Exploit code
		- Creating tool but <u>NOT running</u>
	- Delivery
		- Attacker finds vector for #Payload
		- [[Malware Infections#Threat vector|Threat vector]]
	- Exploitation
		- The moment code is executed and running
		- "Phase 1"
	- Installation
		- During #Exploit it will install additional code to maintain remote access and achieve persistence
		- "Phase 2"
	- Command and Control
		- Where weaponized code talks to an outside server to use additional functions ^002bc8
		- Able to remotely use host at this point
		- Establishes 2 way communication
	- Actions on objectives
		- Whatever the goal is
			- Data extraction, Damage, etc
- Map out security plan based on steps
	- Detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, destroy

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
---
- Adversary tactics, technique, and common knowledge
- <u>Attack navigator</u>
	- attack.mitre.org
	- Can click different types and colors to get TTP
	- Each one will give you more info
	- Map of possible methodology for attack and defense
- Knowledge based maintained by MITRE organization
- More iterative or thinking across multiple lines
	- Matrices
	- Many categories of attacks
- <u>Focus</u> on [[Disk Encryption#^501400|Encryption]] phase
- pre-ATT&CK
	- Focus on #Reconnaissance
	- Aligns with #Reconnaissance and weaponization in Lockheed kill chain [[#Attack Frameworks]]
	- Detect before it is a problem

## Diamond Model of Intrusion analysis
---
- Focus on <u>intrusion event</u>
- Categories
	- Victim
	- Capability
	- Adversary
	- #Infrastructure
- For each incident you want to map the event out
- Flow
	- Victim notices/discovers [[Malware]]
	- Ability to see you've been hacked
	- As you do IR you may see a #C2 server being called
		- This will point to a #Infrastructure
	- [[Firewalls]] logs can point to an IP being accessed by several hosts
		- Additional information on #Infrastructure and victim discovery
	- IP details add info on Adversary
- Once all is identified <u>define a tuple</u>
	- A finite ordered list of elements ^d9cef6
	- Create an array with 4 categories and other metadata
	- "E = {something}"
	- Helps with an automated info like a #SIEM
- Models can be used individually or combined
