- Security vs convenience
	- <u>More security can lead to less convenience</u>
	- By making things more difficult for users it may lead to less security
	- Balance needed
- Types of security
	- Information Security
		- Act of protecting <u>data and information</u> from unauthorized access, unlawful modification, disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction
		- Data that system is holding <u>NOT</u> the system itself
	- Information System Security
		- Securing the <u>systems</u> that hold and process critical data
		- System holding data but <u>NOT</u> the actual data

# CyberSecurity Models
---
- CIA
	- Confidentiality
		- Info not being disclosed to unauthorized people
		- #Encryption
	- Integrity
		- Confirm data has not been modified by unauthorized people
		- #Hashing
	- Availability
		- Data easily and readily accessible
		- Stored, accessible, and protected at all times
		- #Uptime
- AAA
	- Authentication
		- <u>Proof of identity</u> and systems confirms
		- Methods:
			- Something you know
				- User/Pass
			- Something you are
				- Finger/Eye
			- Something you have
				- Token/card

# Threat Hunting
---
- Cyber security technique designed to detect presence of threats not discovered by normal security monitoring
- Is a proactive method vs reactive such as in Incident Response
- Potentially less disrupting than pen test
	- Analyze data within systems you already have
- Process
	- Hypothesis
		- Based from threat model and based on potential events with higher likelihood and impact
		- Who would harm us?
		- How would they harm us?
	- Profiling Threat Actors
		- Create scenarios how intrusion might happen and what motive is TTP
		- Who wants to cause harm?
		- What systems?
	- Hunting
		- Using tools for regular security and IR
			- Logs, file, registry changes
			- A #SIEM
		- Assume regular security systems have failed
		- Examples
			- Network traffic analysis
				- List of suspicious hosts
			- Check executables on hosts
				- Confirm validity of processes
			- Check other hosts
				- Compare similarities
			- Identify how the [[Malware]] came about
- Can consume a lot of resources but can yield some benefits
	- Improve detection capabilities
	- Integrate new info into #Intelligence
		- Corelating external info with internal logs
		- Actionable #Intelligence
	- Reduce attack surface
	- Block attack vectors
	- Identify critical assets
		- Improve monitoring around those systems

# Attack Frameworks
---

## Lockheed Martin Kill Chain
- About
	- First made under contract
	- Release to public eventually
	- <u>Linear</u> outside from perimeter to inside path
	- Somewhat older
- Steps
	- #Reconnaissance
		- Attacker determines methods to use to attack
		- Attackers try to have a low profile
		- Use #OSINT and passive tools
		- Go from passive to active scanning/actions
		- Identifying where/how to attack target
	- Weaponization
		- Attackers couple #Payload with #Exploit  code
		- Creating tool NOT running
	- Delivery
		- Attacker finds vector for #Payload
	- Exploitation
		- The moment code is executed and running
		- "Phase 1"
	- Installation
		- During #Exploit it will install additional code to maintain remote access and achieve persistence
		- "Phase 2"
	- #C2 (Command and Control)
		- Where weaponized code talks to an outside server to use additional functions
		- Able to remotely use host at this point
		- Establish 2 way communication
	- Actions on objectives
		- Whatever the goal is
			- Data extraction, Damage, etc
- Map out security plan based on steps
	- Detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, destroy

## MITRE AA&CK Framework
---
- Adversary tactics, technique, common knowledge or procedures
- attack.mitre.org
	- <u>Attack navigator</u>
		- Can click different types and colors to get TTP
		- Each one will give you more info
		- Map of possible methodology for attack and defense
- Knowledge based maintained by MITRE organization
- More iterative or thinking across multiple lines
	- Matrices
	- Many categories of attacks
- <u>Focus</u> on #Encryption   phase
- pre-ATT&CK
	- Focus on #Reconnaissance
	- Aligns with #Reconnaissance and weaponization in Lockheed kill chain [[#Attack Frameworks]]
	- Detect before it is a problem
## Diamond Model of Intrusion analysis
- Focus on <u>intrusion event</u>
- Categories
	- Victim
	- Capability
	- Adversary
	- #Infrastructure
- For each incident you want to map the event out
- Flow
	- Victim notices/discovers [[Malware]]
	- Ability to see you've been hacked
	- As you do IR you may see a #C2 server being called
		- This will point to a #Infrastructure
	- Firewall logs can point to an IP being accessed by several hosts
		- Additional information on #Infrastructure and victim discovery
	- IP details add info on Adversary
	- Model
		- ![[Diamond-Model.png]]
- Once all is identified define a tuple
	- An array with 4 categories and other metadata
	- "E = {something}"
	- Helps with an automated info like a #SIEM
	- Model
		- ![[Diamond-E=.png]]
## All
---
- Can use individually or combined
- Example
