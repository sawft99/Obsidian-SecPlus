# About
---
- The process of analyzing the security posture of a network’s or system’s #Infrastructure  in an effort to identify and possibly exploit any security [[Risk Assessments#Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]] found
- Can be done by a person or team
- AKA "Pen Test"

# Performing Test
---
- Differs from a [[Vulnerability Management#Vulnerability Assessment|Vulnerability Assessment]] because there is usually no credentials provided
	- Pen testing analysis from the outside where as a [[Vulnerability Management#Vulnerability Assessment|Vulnerability Assessment]] is from the outside
- They are conducted in a [[Testing Methods#Blackbox Testing|Blackbox]] form
	- Sometimes a [[Testing Methods#Whitebox Testing|Whitebox]] is done
	- May save time and money by providing some information to pen testers
- They will attempt to bypass your [[Firewalls]] and other defenses to find [[Risk Assessments#Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]] in the network
	- Like a [[Vulnerability Management#Vulnerability Assessment|Vulnerability Assessment]] the tests are a snapshot in time
	- You will receive a full report when the testing is concluded
- Can be simulated from a CLI with tools like Metasploit and CANVAS
- Can also determine if employees are following their training with phishing tests/campaigns or other #SocialEngineering attacks

# Steps
---
1. Get permission from the client and gather documentation
2. Conduct #Reconnaissance 
3. Enumerate targets to identify known [[Risk Assessments#Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]]
4. #Exploit the target to gain user or privilege access
5. Document results of test and deliver to client

# Techniques and Methods
---
1. Typically start with attempting to gain some kind of foothold in the network
	1. Such as phishing campaign to get credentials
2. [[Active Intercept & Privilege Escalation|Privilege Escalation]] if possible otherwise they will attempt to Pivot
	1. Occurs when an attacker moves onto another workstation or user account
3. This allows them to establish Persistence
	1. Ability for an attacker to maintain a foothold inside a compromised network
