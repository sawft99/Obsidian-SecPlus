# About
---
- Creating a baseline of the network to assess the current security state of computers, servers, network devices, and the entire network in general ^5f2432
- Use a variety of tools and methods to conduct such as
	- [[#Network Mapping]]
	- [[#Vulnerability Scanning]]
	- [[#Network Sniffing]]
	- [[#Password Analysis]]
- See also
	- [[Vulnerability Management#Vulnerability Assessment|Vulnerability Assessment]]

# Network Mapping
---
- Used for discovery and documentation of your physical and logical connectivity that exists in the network
- Determine how network is set up and way data will flow
- Often one of the first tools used
- Software
	- Solarwinds - Commercial
	- ZenMap - Free
- [[Wireless Access Points (WAP)#Heatmaps|Heatmaps]] are also a form of Network Mapping

# Vulnerability Scanning

## About
---
- A technique that identifies [[Risk Assessments#Threats|Threats]] that exist on the network without using an #Exploit for them ^c7fb7f
- Can be very basic or extremely advanced in its tools
- Examples
	- Open ports, services, shares, user accounts, versions, OS and more
- Software
	- Nmap - Free
	- Nesus - Commercial
	- Qualysguard - Commercial

## Banner Grabbing
---
- A technique used to gain information about the servers and inventory the systems or services ^91d225
- Conducted during [[#Vulnerability Scanning]]

# Network Sniffing

## About
---
- Process of finding and investigating other computers on the network by analyzing the network traffic or capturing the packets being sent ^a67236
- Aka Packet Sniffer or [[#Protocol Analyzer]]

## Protocol Analyzer
---
- Software tool that allows for the capture, reassembly, and analysis of packets from the network ^2a4690
- Makes it more robust then a normal [[#Network Sniffing]]
- Example
	- Wireshark - Free
- See also
	- [[NIDS & NIPS#Protocol Analyzer]]
