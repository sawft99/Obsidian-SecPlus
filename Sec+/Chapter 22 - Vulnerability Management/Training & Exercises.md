# Tabletop Exercise (TTX)
---
- Exercises that use an incident scenario against a framework of controls or a red team ^f4c239
- Discussion of simulated emergency situations
- Theoretical in nature and not always practical evidence
	- Actually going through the steps in a tabletop is part of the [[Penetration Testing]] process

# Penetration Test

## About
---
- A test that uses active tools and security utilities to evaluate security by simulating on a system to verify if [[Risk Assessments#Threats|Threats]] exist, actively test it, bypass [[Security Controls]] and then finally #Exploit [[Risk Assessments#Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]] on a given system ^e9d3c5
- Don't confuse with the act of [[Penetration Testing]] 
- Prior to conducting make sure the work is properly scoped and resourced
	- Exactly what will be tested
	- For example access to a [[Defeding the Servers#Domain Controller|Domain Controller]]
## Process
---
1. Test the system to discover [[Risk Assessments#Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]] or prove [[Security Controls]]
2. Examine the system to identify any logical weaknesses
3. Interview personnel to gather information as part of #SocialEngineering 

# Red Teams
---
- The <u>hostile or attackers</u> in a [[#Penetration Test]] or Incident Response exercise ^ca9b0e
- Individuals who are performing adversarial simulation and penetration testing
- This can refer to an external or internal team
- If you are conducting your own [[#Penetration Test]] it is a good practice to have a dedicated red team since people like systems administrators can be biased
	- Want to prove systems are secure and not that they can be attacked

# Blue Teams
---
- The <u>defensive</u> team in a [[#Penetration Test]] or incident response exercise ^c302b4
- System administrators, Cybersecurity analysts, etc

# Purple Teams
---
- Individuals who perform different tactics to maximize the effectiveness of [[#Red Teams]] and [[#Blue Teams]] operations ^acc223

# White Teams
---
- <u>Staff</u> administering, evaluating, and supervising a [[#Penetration Test]] or incident response exercise ^2dc833
- Building the network if using a third party network in your test
- Some organizations don't want to perform active tests on their production network, so they will build a training network for [[#Red Teams]] and [[#Blue Teams]]
- Reporters after events on what [[#Red Teams]] and [[#Blue Teams]] did performance wise
