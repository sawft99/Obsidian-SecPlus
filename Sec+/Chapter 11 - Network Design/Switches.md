# About
---
- Hubs
	- Originally traffic would go into one port and out all other ports in what was called a "broadcast"
	- As networks got larger this caused many collisions
- Bridges
	- Evolution after hubs
	- Separate physical LAN to WAN into 2 logical networks or connect 2 logical networks
- Switches
	- The evolution of both Hubs and Bridges combined
	- Every port is like a bridge and hub on each port
	- Intelligence use of MAC and only sending out traffic to the MAC in question
	- Improves overall security and reduces traffic
