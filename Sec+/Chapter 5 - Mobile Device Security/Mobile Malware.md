---
- [[Endpoint Analysis#AntiVirus (AV)|AntiVirus]] is available for some mobile platforms
	- Mobile devices also subject to [[Malware]]
	- #IPhone and #Android do have options

## Patching OS
---
- Ensure devices are patched and updated
	- [[Updates and Patches]]

- #IPhone
	- Updates are automatically made available and applied

	- Google creates a "base" version
		- They only patch vulnerabilities and their own hardware
		- Most people don't use a Google device (Pixel) vs Samsung, HTC, etc.
	- Usually need to get #Android updates from the manufacturers which can be weeks or months behind
		-  #Android  considered <u>somewhat less secure</u> for this reason vs #IPhone  IF you keep it up to date

## Patching Apps
---
- Stores check code for [[Malware]] before being put in store
	- Signature based scanning and other [[#Endpoint Analysis AntiVirus (AV) Antivirus|Antivirus]] techniques
- Also digitally signed which <u>stops code form being modified</u>
- [[Malware]] has made its way into the stores before
	- So simply getting it from the store <u>DOES NOT</u> mean it will be100% free of [[Malware]]
	- Still better chance than other sources
- #IPhone
	- App store
- #Android
	- Play store
