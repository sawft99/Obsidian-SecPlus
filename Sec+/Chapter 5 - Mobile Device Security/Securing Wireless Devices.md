- Methods
	- [[#Wifi]]
	- [[#Bluetooth]]
- <u>Using wireless communications</u> in any way can lower [[SecBasics#Cybersecurity Models|Confidentiality]]
	- If you need to then look at manufacturer specs for encryptions used to judge

# Wifi
---
- Protect at the "highest level" with [[Disk Encryption#^501400|Encryption]]
	- Wifi Protected Access 2 (WPA 2) ^fa413c
		- Uses [[Disk Encryption#Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES Encryption]]

# Bluetooth
---
- Need to secure peripherals as well such as a phone that connects to a car over Bluetooth
- By default a shared <u>link key</u> is created to encrypt the connection between 2 devices
	- Keys are shared to each other
	- Some devices use weak [[Disk Encryption#^501400|Encryption]]
- [[Bluetooth Attacks]]
