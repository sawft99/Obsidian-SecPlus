# About
---
- Copper, Fiber, and Coax cabling ^d94e51
- Patch panels, Punch down blocks, and Network jacks  ^c74888

# Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

## About
---
- A disturbance that can affect the electrical circuits, devices, and cables due to radiation or electromagnetic conduction ^5867f0
- Many devices can cause this
	- TV
	- Microwave
	- Cordless phones
	- Motors
	- Baby monitor 

## Prevention
---
- Shielding
	- Shielding with STP cables or the source of the EMI
	- STP can either have foil around entire bundle of wires or each individual twisted pair inside the cable ^58f72d
	- Stops EMI from getting out or in

# Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)

## About
---
- A disturbance that can affect electrical circuits, devices, and cables such as AM/FM transmissions or cell towers ^88a308
- Can cause issues in wireless networks

## Prevention
---
- Shield building
- Get stronger devices that can overcome the RFI

# Crosstalk

## About
---
- Occurs when a signal transmitted on one copper wire creates an undesired effect on another wire ^390666
- Close proximity EMI

## Prevention
---
- Use newer 110 blocks which also have better spacing
	- Old 66 punch down blocks for networking 
- Cat 3 Ethernet or some Cat 5
	- Get newer or better quality cables
- STP Cables
	- Good for [[#Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)]], [[#Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)]], and [[#Crosstalk]]
	- More expensive usually by about ~%50
	- Easier to work with

# Plugging into Switches

## About
---
- Attackers may physically plug into an RJ45 port
- Either directly into switch or somewhere with an open port

## Prevention
---
- [[Firewalls#MAC Filtering|MAC Filtering]]
- [[VLAN]]
- [[Network Access Control]]

# Data Emanation

## About
---
- The electromagnetic field generated by a network cable or device when transmitting ^d45536
- Comes from inside the cable rather than outside
- Someone could theoretically 'listen' to that traffic
- More of a concern for high level security institutions

## Spectrum Analyzer
---
- Device used for capturing [[#Data Emanation]]
- Captures all radio frequencies
- Can "tune in" to specific network frequency

## Prevention
---
- Fiber cables
	- Uses light instead electricity and radiation
- They have no [[#Data Emanation]] at all
- Immune to [[#Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)]] and [[#Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)]]
- However, fiber splitters do exist for [[#Passive Listening]]

```

# Passive Listening
---
- An attacker could plug into a punch down block/panel and get a copy of network data
	- More common in telephone networks using a butt phone
- An attacker can split the wires on a twisted pair and solder on additional wires to passively listen to data then return other cables to network
	- Or use an Ethernet Tap device
- Essentially invisible

# Protected Distribution Systems (PDS)
---
- Secured system of cable management to ensure that the <u>wired network</u> stays free from eavesdropping, tapping, [[#Data Emanation]], and other threats ^7d7664
- Expensive
- Add locks to all closets
- Enclose all cable distribution points
- Run cables through protected conduit in the celling
