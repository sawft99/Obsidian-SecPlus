# About
---
- A standardized framework used for port based [[Authentication]] on wired and wireless networks
- As a frameworks it uses other mechanisms to handle [[Authentication]]
	- RADIUS
	- TACAS+
- Prevents "rogue devices"
- 3 [[#Roles]] required for 802.1x
	- [[#Supplicant]]
	- [[#Authenticator]]
	- [[#Authentication Server]]

# Roles

## Supplicant
---
- Device or user requesting access to then network

## Authenticator
---
- The device through which the [[#Supplicant]] is trying to access the network
- Such as a [[Wireless Access Points (WAP)]] or [[Switches]]

## Authentication Server
---
- The central device that performs [[Authentication]]
- Such as RADIUS or TACAS+

# Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

## About
---
- A framework of [[Ports and Protocols|Protocols]] that allows numerous methods of [[Authentication]] including password, digital certificates, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## EAP-MD5
---
- A variant of [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]] that uses simple passwords in a challenge authentication process
- One way authentication that <u>doesn't provide</u> [[#^539a82|Mutual Authentication]]
- Least secure implementation

## EAP-TLS
---
- A variant of [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]] that uses PKI with a digital certificate <u>on the client AND server</u>
- VS [[#EAP-TTLS]] where the client uses a password and no certificate
- Immune to password based attacks since neither side uses a password but rather a certificate
- Uses [[#^539a82|Mutual Authentication]]

## EAP-TTLS
---
- A variant of [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]] that requires a certificate on the server <u>but not the client</u> which instead uses a password
- VS [[#EAP-TLS]] where client and server need a certificate
- Not as secure as [[#EAP-TLS]] but more secure than [[#EAP-MD5]]

## Protected EAP (PEAP)
---
- A variant of [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]] that supports [[#^539a82|Mutual Authentication]] by using server certificates and #Microsoft [[Group Policies#Active Directory|Active Directory]] to authenticate a clients password


# EAP-FAST
---
- A variant of [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]] that provides flexible [[Authentication]] via secure tunneling (FAST) by using a [[#^84f686|Protected Access Credential]] instead of a certificate for [[#^539a82|Mutual Authentication]]
- "Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling" 
- Put forward by #Cisco  to replace [[#Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)]]
- CAN have a server certificate

# Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)
---
- #Cisco proprietary [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]]
- Network needs to run on #Cisco or devices need to support it through some other way such as a client application
