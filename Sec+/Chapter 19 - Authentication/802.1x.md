# About
---
- A standardized framework used for port based [[Authentication]] on wired and wireless networks
- As a frameworks it uses other mechanisms to handle [[Authentication]]
	- RADIUS
	- TACAS+
- Prevents "rogue devices"
- 3 [[#Roles]] required for 802.1x

# Roles

## Supplicant
---
- Device or user requesting access to then network

## Authenticator
---
- The device through which the [[#Supplicant]] is trying to access the network
- Such as a [[Wireless Access Points (WAP)]] or [[Switches]]

## Authentication Server
---
- The central device that performs [[Authentication]]
- Such as RADIUS or TACAS+

# Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

## About
---
- A framework of [[Ports and Protocols|Protocols]] that allows numerous methods of [[Authentication]] including password, digital certificates, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## EAP-MD5
---
- A variant of [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]] that uses simple passwords in a challenge authentication process
- One way authentication that <u>doesn't provide</u> [[#^539a82|Mutual Authentication]]

## EAP-TLS
---
- A variant of [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]] that uses PKI with a digital certificate on the client and server
- VS
- Immune to password based attacks since neither side uses a password but rather a certificate
- Uses [[#^539a82|Mutual Authentication]]

## EAP-TTLS
---
- A variant of [[#Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)]] that requires a certificate on the server but not the client
- VS [[#EAP-TLS]] where client and server need a certficiate

# Vocab
---
- Mutual Authentication ^539a82
	- Both client and server verify each others [[Identity]] ^a4d38f
