# Obsidian-SecPlus

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault containing notes on CompTIA Sec+ course. Includes information from various sources. [Study Guide](Sec+/About/Study%20Guide.md) blank due to excluding copyright material from the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus) created by [Dijon Training](https://www.diontraining.com/).

# Plugins
Most of these are not essential but it is what I am using for myself in this vault

- [Advanced Tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian)
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)
- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
- [Admonition](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition)
- [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)
- [Find Unlinked Files](https://github.com/Vinzent03/find-unlinked-files)
- [Hotkey Helper](https://github.com/pjeby/hotkey-helper)
- [Obsidian Sortable](https://github.com/alexandru-dinu/obsidian-sortable)
- [Obsidian HTML Reader](https://github.com/nuthrash/obsidian-html-plugin)
- [Obsidian Underline](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-underline)
- [Influx](https://github.com/jensmtg/influx)
- [Media Extended](https://github.com/aidenlx/media-extended)

- [Obsidian42 - Strange New Worlds](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-strange-new-worlds)

If nothing else Influx and Strange New Worlds do a great job of linking information. Obsidian Sortable is convenient and simply allows you to sort a table however you like. I use the [KanBan board](Sec+/Resources/Sec+Board.md) to keep a "To do" list.

# Additional info
Use 'reading view' where possible. It looks better and embedded videos will show up properly

```dataview
Table from "Sec+"
flatten file.folder
```
